# Bike Sharing

This case study is to help BikeIndia to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after the ongoing quarantine situation which ends across the nation due to Covid-19. The company planned to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
